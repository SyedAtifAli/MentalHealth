<!--        <b>The 3 C's of resilience</b><br></br><br></br>-->
<!--        In psychology, resilience is defined as the ability to adapt well in the face of adversity,-->
<!--        trauma, tragedy, threats and significant sources of stress. According to the psycologist-->
<!--        Susan Kobasa, there are 3 elements that are necessary to cultivate resilience, namely-challenge, commitment and control.-->
<!--        <br></br><br></br><b>Element 1: Challenge</b><br></br><br></br>-->
<!--        According to the first element, resilience involves-->
<!--not getting paralysed in the face of adversity. It-->
<!--means shifting your perspective to look at setbacks-->
<!--as a challenge that can be overcome. Being resilient-->
<!--means approaching challenges with an open mind,-->
<!--looking at failures as lessons, and considering-->
<!--obstacles as opportunities for personal growth.-->
<!--    <br></br><br></br><br></br><b>Element 2: Commitment</b><br></br><br></br>-->
<!--    The second element emphasises the fact that-->
<!--resilience involves having a high sense of-->
<!--commitment. It means having deep and meaningful-->
<!--relationships with others which will motivate you-->
<!--to move forward. Essentially, your commitment and-->
<!--care will encourage you to keep going even when-->
<!--faced with adversities.-->
<!--         <br></br><br></br><br></br><b>Element 3: Control</b><br></br><br></br>-->
<!--        And finally, the last element denotes that resilience-->
<!--means focusing your time and energy on situations-->
<!--you have control over. Instead of worrying about-->
<!--what you cannot change or don't have control over,-->
<!--you work towards things that are controllable.-->
<!--By doing so, you will feel more confident and-->
<!--empowered to take on any challenges.-->
